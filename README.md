## Overview
The Rule Engine with AST is a 3-tier application designed to determine user eligibility based on attributes such as age, department, income, and spend. The application utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules and allows for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 22
- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend RESTful APIs
- **PostgreSQL**: As the relational database
- **JDBI**: For database access
- **Lombok**: For reducing boilerplate code in Java classes
- **Liquibase**: For managing database migrations
- **React**: For the frontend user interface

## Features
- Create, combine, and evaluate rules using a user-friendly interface.
- Dynamic handling of rules with AST representation.
- Secure API endpoints using JWT for authentication.
- Database migrations managed via Liquibase.

## Installation
### Backend
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rule-engine
   ```
2. Set up PostgreSQL and create a database for the application.
3. Update `application.properties` with your database configuration.
4. Run Liquibase migrations:
   ```bash
   mvn liquibase:update
   ```
5. Build and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Use Postman or any API client to interact with the backend API endpoints.
- Access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000` after starting the React app.

## Testing
- Unit and integration tests can be found in the `/test` directory. Run the tests using:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: Implemented JWT for securing API endpoints.
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries with JDBI.
